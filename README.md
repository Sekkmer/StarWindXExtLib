# StarWindXExtLib

This library is an extension for StarWindX in C#, right now this project can be split into two parts:

I.: Extension for IDevice, ILSFSDevice, IHADevice including snapshot mounting for LSFS and interface add/remove for HADevices

II.: Appender classes containing most of the functions: adding target/devices and creating files you can interact with then throw interfaces
