# StarWindXExtLib

This library is an extension for StarWindX in C#, right now this project can be split into two parts:

I.: Extension for IDevice, ILSFSDevice, IHADevice including snapshot mounting for LSFS and interface add/remove for HADevices

II.: Appender classes containing most of the functions: adding target/devices and creating files you can interact with then throw interfaces

Some of the classes have not been tested yet, but I should finish the testing and fixing in the next few weeks.

Some functions are implemented but unable to work due to StarWindX problems.: AdnvacedHA creation, HA snapshot mount (the last might work but I have not tested it yet)

Feel free to use any part of my code however you like it.
